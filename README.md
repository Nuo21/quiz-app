# <Week 4 Challenge- Code Quiz>

## Description

Quizzes are a fun way to test your knowledge on certain topics! There are many kinds of quizzes, but this one will test the user on their knowledge of Javascript. There are only five questions in this short quiz, and the user will be given 40 seconds to complete it. Each time the user answers incorrectly, the timer will be reduced by 9 seconds! Once the quiz is finished, the total score will be revealed based on how many questions were answered correctly. A little text field will also appear asking the user to enter their initials to save their score and submit it to the Highscores list.
